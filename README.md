==========
A command-line image processing tool written in Rust

Currently a WIP

Functions:
 - Image downscaling
 - Use fast k-means clustering approximation to get the 'common colors' of an image
 - Detect the edges of an image using a variable threshold value and save the result as a new image
 - Batch resizing of an image

 Generally speaking, all of the above is very WIP and not done yet
